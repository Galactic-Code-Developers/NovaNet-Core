## Overview
NovaNet is a next-generation blockchain integrating AI-powered governance, quantum-assisted validator selection, and quantum-resistant security. Built for scalability, efficiency, and interoperability, NovaNet introduces:

* Quantum Delegated Proof-of-Stake (Q-DPoS) – AI-optimized validator selection and staking rewards  
* AI-Powered Governance Automation – Fraud detection and proposal scoring  
* Quantum-Secure Smart Contracts – Post-quantum cryptographic protection  
* AI-Driven Treasury Optimization – Dynamic fund allocation and risk assessment  
* Cross-Chain Bridges – Seamless interoperability with Ethereum, Polkadot, Cosmos, and Solana  
* NVIDIA Jetson Orin Integration – AI-enhanced validator ranking and fraud detection
